Fundamental theorem of arithmatic
--------------------------------------

5 = 3+2
15 = 3+3+3+3+3

25 = 5+5+5+5+5

32 =2x8

like this any compoite number (not prime numbers) can be written
 as sum of equal prime numbers

some numbers have more than one primes:

30 = 3x10
30 = 2X15
30 = 5x6

We can see 2,3 and 5 all can .this known as factorization

we call 2,3,5 are prime factors of 30

if we found all the prime factors of given number then we can
 create that number from prime factors as below:

 example :
 30 = (2^x)*(3^y)*(5^z)

where x,y,z are non negative integers.

in  this case
x=y=z=1

30 =2x3x5

also we call this, 2x3x5 is prime factorization of 30
this is unique and no other way to build 30 with using another prime numbers

so every posible numbers has one and only one prime factorization

no  different two numbers share  prime factorizations.


Public key cryptograpy
--------------------------------------

to first share a secret random number, known as a key.
2:25So how could two people who have never met
2:27agree on a secret shared key
2:30without letting Eve, who is always listening,
2:34also obtain a copy?
2:37In 1976, Whitfield Diffie & Martin Hellman
2:41devised an amazing trick to do this.
2:44First, let's explore how this trick is done using colors.
2:48How could Alice and Bob agree on a secret color without Eve finding it out?
2:53The trick is based on two facts:
2:56one, it's easy to mix two colors together to make a third color; and
3:02two, given a mixed color, it's hard to reverse it
3:06in order to find the exact original colors.
3:10This is the basis for a lock:
3:12easy in one direction, hard in the reverse direction.
3:16This is known as a one-way function.
3:20Now, the solution works as follows:
3:23First, they agree publicly on a starting color, say yellow.
3:29Next, Alice and Bob both randomly select private colors,
3:35and mix them into the public yellow in order to disguise their private colors.
3:40Now, Alice keeps her private color and sends her mixture to Bob,
3:46and Bob keeps his private color and sends his mixture to Alice.
3:53Now, the heart of the trick:
3:57Alice and Bob add their private colors to the other person's mixture
4:02and arrive at a shared secret color.
4:09Notice how Eve is unable to determine this exact color,
4:13since she needs one of their private colors to do so.
4:20And that is the trick.
4:23Now, to do this with numbers, we need a numerical procedure
4:27which is easy in one direction and hard in the other.


one way easy, backway hard

this we call modular arithmatic, or clock arithmatic

example clock modulus
46 mod 12 = 10 
how we get 10 ?
easy  cycle of 12 equal parts of 12 and 46 length of rope wraping rope the cycle we get 10
12 one cycle, 24 two cycle, 36 three cycles , then we have 10 remining thats the value

4 mod 12 = 4
10 mod 12 = 10
12 mod 12 = 12
13 mod 12 = 1
15 mod 12 = 3

this result is less than or equal to 12,



prime modulus:
 we can select 17  for cycle, then 
  example 
  3 mod 17 = 3 
  3^2 mod 17 = 9

  then we choose x, as:
  3^x mod 17 = z 
  then we can find any integer z from 0 to 17 for any of  non negative integer x 

  3^4  mod 17 = 13
  3^5 mod 17 = 5 

3^16  mod 17 = 1

3 is knows as the generator

and revers procedure is hard,
say given z=12  and find x its hard
this is call The discrete logarithm problem



then we have one way function easy to perform and hard to revers.

and its too hard when we choose big prime number for 17


Diffie-hellman key exchange
----------------------------------------
----------------------------------------


Alice Bob clients problem:

g=3, and p =17 

3^x mod 17  = z

g^x mod p = z

1. we share publicly same values of g and p between  Alice and Bob
2. Alice get random integer lessthan p  =>> x=aPrivate=15,
Calculate:
3^15 mod 17 = 6 = Apub

3. Bob get random integer lessthan p, =>> x=bPrivate=13,
Calculate:
3^13 mod 17 = 12 = bPub

Bob public key : bPub=12 => share to Alice
bPub^aPrivate mod 17 = 12^15 mod 17 = 10

Alice public key : Apub=6 => share to Bob
Apub^bPrivate mod 17 = 6^13 mod 17 = 10


we got same shared key = 10
we can use this key to encrypt data and decrypt
