RSA Encryption
only share lock key

Open lock share => lock message from other client => recieve to lock key owner => open lock 


Alice 
Encryption key 
Decrption key


Share Encryption key of Alice to Bob.

Bob
Encryption key of Alice
encrypt data using Encryption key of Alice
Send to Alice

Alice decrypt the data using his Decrption key.



2:24let's do a simplified exampled with colors.
2:28How could Bob send Alice a specific color,
2:31without Eve, who is always listening, intercepting it?
2:35The inverse of some color is called a complimentary color,
2:40which when added to it, produces white,
2:45undoing the effect of the first color.
2:49In this example, we assume that mixing colors
2:51is a one-way function because it's fast to mix colors
2:54and output a third, and it's much slower to undo.
3:01Alice first generates her private key
3:05by randomly selecting a color, say red.
3:08Next, assume Alice uses a secret color machine
3:11to find the exact compliment of her red
3:14and nobody else has access to this.
3:17This results in cyan, which she sends to Bob
3:20as her public key.
3:23Let's say Bob wants to send a secret yellow to Alice.
3:26He mixes this with her public color
3:29and sends the resulting mixture back to Alice.
3:32Now Alice adds her private color to Bob's mixture.
3:37This undoes the effect of her public color,
3:40leaving her with Bob's secret color.
3:43Notice Eve has no easy way to find Bob's yellow,
3:45since she needs Alice's private red to do so.
3:49This is how it should work.
3:51However, a mathematical solution was needed
